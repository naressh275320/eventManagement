Event Management App

This Android app streamlines scheduling meetings with multiple people using an intuitive checkbox-based selection system. Users can select multiple contacts from their list, assign individual meeting times to each person while setting a 
common date for all events, and save everything with a single click. The app features a comprehensive view of all scheduled events, automatically filtering out past dates to show only upcoming meetings. Built with Room database for reliable
local storage, it includes full CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) for managing events efficiently.

Additionally, users can share their event schedules directly to WhatsApp with properly formatted messages showing dates and times in 12-hour AM/PM format.
